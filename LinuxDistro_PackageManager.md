Im Not saying that i am Qualified to say that i know oll ins and outs of every or any linux package manager. but the current state of things is a complete disaster.

stuff like snaps , flatpacks and appimg, are a step in the wrong direction, even if they are a solution to a problem, and possibly a working solotion to that problem

its the WRONG solution for the problem, and taking that direction while convienient is a step in the wrong direction and will make fixing the actual problem even harder and more importantly even less people actually willing to actually getting involved into looking for an actual solution.

Short overview of where i come from and what ive seen so , so hopefully people wanting to comment with its not as bad as you think or , its better then it used to be .. might think maybe i should take a good look at what the factual situation is.

First linux Distro i ever installed was : RED HAT 8.0 Psyche.(not long after it launched ~2003/4), by 2005 i had distro hopped a bit Suse,Mandrake,Yoper,Debian Woody, slackware,... and did my first gentoo install.. did that for a while , distro hopped again since compiling times on a Athlon 2500+ single core with 256mb ram,were a bit long if you actually needed a program for something. Arch (wich was somehow harder to get operational) then sabayon (gentoo based, but rigo had also binaries so.) 

anyway installing stuff on redhat 8.0 was a breeze untill you wanted to install a recent version of GAIN or whatever...(or amsn messenger cant remember) then it became really fun , no package for red hat but one for mandrake, could it work, needed that lib of wich the latest version was only availeble as a tar.gz, ./configer make... wait , thats ./configure ,,, missing 5 depencies , ah yeey two of them are availeble as rpm, for suse but lets try them, conflicting versions for other depencies on them packages ... so .. intalling an up to date gaim and getting it working was an afternoon of work.

things have changed allot... first of all every scripting language comes with its own packagemanager these days , pip,cargo,npm, then there is github , gitlab... back then there was svn(and something prior to that cant remember the name), and you werent going to use that to install anything.

this brings me to the first problem with almost EVERY distro package manager these days.:

since everything is repacked , the actual developers have no idea wheter or not one of there projects is downloaded or used allot or not and if he knew that it actually was massively used by allot of people, they might considder shifting priorities. and give that project some more attention. or get some help on the project.

what happens now is that if the project has  a bug in a certain situation
