In the past, PCs used the Master Boot Record (MBR) to determine where to find the kernel of the operating system. The MBR was located in the first sector of the floppy disk and contained a pointer to the kernel's location on the drive. However, the BIOS had no way of accounting for all possible kernel locations, so the MBR had to point to the start of the first partition, which could then contain another MBR or the actual kernel.

A BIOS was a relatively straightforward system, hence the name: Basic Input Output System. Once loaded, it performed a Power-On Self Test (POST), which tested the available hardware, including drives and other media, and assigned IRQs as necessary. Then, the BIOS determined where to go next based on a setting that allowed selection of one of: [Floppy, Primary Master, Primary Slave, Secondary Master, Secondary Slave].

Nowadays, PCs use the GUID Partition Table (GPT), which is a larger table that holds information on the locations and types of partitions, defined by a GUID. The GPT structure is designed to be more flexible than the MBR, with no limit on the number of partitions. Additionally, GPT includes the partition type, which is defined by the GUID. There is no longer a boot flag, but the BIOS or newer SuperIO can understand the GPT structure and look for the EFI System Partition (ESP), where EFI bootloaders can be listed and booted.

To ensure compatibility, it's recommended to format disks using GPT with at least one ESP partition of 1024MB in size and one partition for the system root. It's also a good idea to set the partition's GUID and PARTLABEL correctly. Note that the PARTLABEL is not the same as the filesystem label. For maximum compatibility, it's best to set the GUID of the partition correctly. This can be done using a tool like gdisk, which provides shorthand codes for common GUID values.
